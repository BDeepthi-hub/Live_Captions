**Project Title: Basic Flask Web Application - Live_Captions**
**Project Description:**
This is a simple web application built using the Flask web framework in Python. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to set up a minimal web server and serve an HTML page.

**Key Features:**
Uses Flask to create a web server.

Serves a homepage (index.html) using Flask's templating engine.

The application runs in debug mode, which is helpful for development and debugging.

**Files Included:**
app.py: The main Python script that creates and runs the Flask web server.

templates/index.html (not provided, but referenced): An HTML template that will be rendered when the user visits the home page (/ route).

**How It Works:**
A Flask application is created.

The route '/' (home page) is defined and linked to the index() function.

When the home page is accessed, it renders an HTML page called index.html from the templates folder.

When you run app.py, the web server starts and listens for incoming requests in debug mode.
